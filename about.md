## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic08.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

  I'm a twelve years old little girlï¼Œyou can call me LeeNian.In the past decades, I have learned a lot of skills, such as eating, drinking, playing, sleeping and so on.I like to look out of the window occasionally, I like the quiet feeling, I like to see the outside world, to see the scenery along the way; I like to live free and free, think of the feeling of galloping horses on the grasslands.<br/>
  <p>Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded.And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand.It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics:You are all stardust.</p>
